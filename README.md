## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Google Fonts - Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) - Font family

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to work with Tailwind CSS v4 and its new `@theme` directive for defining custom design tokens. I also practiced creating a centered card component with proper spacing and responsive design.

Here's an example of the custom theme configuration I used:

```css
@theme {
  --color-white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --color-slate-300: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  --color-slate-500: hsl(216, 15%, 48%);
  --color-slate-900: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);

  --text-base: 15px;

  --font-outfit: "Outfit", sans-serif;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue focusing on:

- Responsive design best practices
- Accessibility improvements
- Advanced Tailwind CSS techniques
- Component reusability

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - This helped me understand the new v4 features and the `@theme` directive.
- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) - Great platform for practicing front-end development skills.
